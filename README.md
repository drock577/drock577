### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My biggest strength is seeing potential solutions to problems you didnâ€™t know exist. I enjoy innovating novel solutions to difficult problems from identifying American Sign Language with just a camera to explaining black box machine learning models. My greatest satisfaction is seeing these innovations work.

I have developed solutions to difficult problems in computer vision, natural language, and reinforcement learning domains. Innovation is fun!
